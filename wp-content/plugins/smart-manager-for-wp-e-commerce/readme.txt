Read what a client had to say:
> What really sold me on this (Smart Manager Pro) was Batch Update. My assistant does not have to do any complex math now (earlier, I always feared she would make a mistake)! With Smart Manager, she has more free time at hand, hence I asked her to set up auto-responder emails for our customers. The response was phenomenal. **Our repeat sales were up by 19.5%. I would happily pay five times for this product!**
> - Jeff Smith

And here's another customer's review on the Pro version:

> We have over 6000 individual lines on our site and this has saved us huge amounts of time.
> Batch update works flawlessly which is a massive time saver, if you need to change all of your prices on the entire site by a % or value, you can with a couple of clicks! We made an update to Tax class on all products in less than 3 minutes. The CSV export tool actually works unlike some I have tried, all 6000 odd lines neatly exported in one attempt. No missing or corrupt data.
