= MyCurator Delivers Vibrant Content for your Site =

Struggling to find time to create content?  Start with what you do 
already, reviewing articles in your industry or niche! MyCurator
will deliver them to your WordPress site where you can easily review
them. 

Our Machine Learning Relevance engine lets you train MyCurator with 
a simple up or down vote on an article.  After just a few articles 
MyCurator will classify the good articles - weeding out 90% or more 
of the junk and spam articles, saving a huge amount of time.

With one click curate the article into your WordPress Editor
with an excerpt, image and attribution ready to go.  Just add a 
paragraph to tell your readers about the article and you've created
content for your site!

MyCurator allows you to curate content for a Topic (equivalent to 
WordPress Categories) for free, but you will have to obtain an API 
Key to access the cloud services.  For those who need to curate a 
lot of different topics or for multiple sites, low priced monthly 
plans are available - always with a free 30 day trial.  

Go to <a href="https://www.target-info.com/pricing/" >Our Site</a> to get your API Key after you install the software.

Visit <a href="https://www.target-info.com/" >MyCurator</a> for more information on
