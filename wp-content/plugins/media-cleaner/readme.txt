Clean your WordPress (broken media, unused media, files). It has its own trash and recovery features. Please read the description.

== Description ==

Clean your Media Library from the media which aren't used in any of your posts, gallery and so on. It features an internal trash, moving the files in there temporarily for you to make sure the files aren't actually in used; once checked, you can trash them permanently. **Before using this plugin, make sure you have a proper backup of your files and database. This is the most important step on the usage of this plugin as you can't trust any file deletion tools.** The Pro version of this plugin brings scanning to the /uploads folder and will detect which files aren't registered in the Media Library, not used in your content and so on. Retina images are also detected and supported, shortcodes, HTML in sidebars and of course your posts, pages and all post types.

A tutorial is available on the official website, here: [Media Cleaner](https://meowapps.com/media-cleaner).

**This tool is a knife. Do not use it if you don't have any backup, or if you don't know what it does. For backup, you can use such a plugin as [UpdraftPlus](https://updraftplus.com/?afref=460).**

**SPECIAL PLUGIN**. Such a plugin is difficult to create and to maintain. If you understand WordPress, you probably know why. This plugin does its best to help you. Learn how to use it and you will get awesome results.

**DASHBOARD**. The files detected as not used will be listed in a specific dashboard. At this point, it will be up to you to delete them. They will be then moved to a trash internal to the plugin. After more testing, you can trash them permanently.

**PRO**. [Media Cleaner Pro](https://meowapps.com/media-cleaner) can scan your physical /uploads directory, and match it against the Media Library. It also has extra support for Page Builders.

**COMPATIBILITY**. I am adding support for specific plugins little by little. Currently, I have been working with ACF, Gutenberg, Divi, Fusion Builder (Avada), WooCommerce, Visual Composer (WPBakery), Elementor, and Beaver Builder. **Specific checks for Page Builders are being added to the Pro version** (as it requires meticulous work and updates).

**AGAIN, BE CAREFUL**. Again, this plugin deletes files so be careful! Backup is not only important, it is **necessary**. Don't use this plugin if you don't understand how WordPress works.
