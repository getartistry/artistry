<p>Leads were renamed to contacts in Mautic 1.4.0.</p>
<p>Contacts are the central factor of a marketing automation platform. These are all the individuals who have visited your websites or interacted with you in some way.</p>
<h3 id="contact-types">Contact Types</h3>
<p>There are two types of contacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visitors</strong> (formerly anonymous leads) &mdash; visitors to your site who have not yet been identified by a form or other interaction.<ul>
<li>These contacts are tracked by Mautic but typically remain hidden so as not to clutter your segment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Standard contacts</strong> &mdash; contacts which have identified themselves via a form or some other source. As a result, these contacts typically have a name, email, and other identifying fields.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="visitors-formerly-anonymous-leads">Visitors (formerly anonymous leads)</h4>
<p>Anonymous leads were renamed to visitors in Mautic 1.4.0.</p>
<p>You can view visitors by using the 'table view' (use the "t" keyboard shortcut to view contacts in a table or "c" as cards) within the contacts section.</p>
<p>Visitors are worth tracking, because these could be future customers. By tracking them before they have any interaction, you can retain a log of when they visited your site, which allows you to get a picture of their activity prior to engaging with you.</p>

<pre><code>is:anonymous

<p><img src="https://www.mautic.org/docs/en/contacts/media/contacts-anonymous.jpg" alt="">
The resulting list will be those IP addresses which have not yet provided identifying information.</p>
<h4 id="standard-contacts">Standard Contacts</h4>
<p>The second type of contact is a standard contact. These contacts have identified themselves via a form or other source &mdash; you may also have more information about them from previous interactions. As a result, these contacts typically have a name, email, and other identifying information which can be associated with the contact.</p>
<p>The standard contact is the preferred contact within Mautic. These are contacts which may have started as a visitor, but at some point provided additional information such as a name, email address, social network handle, or other identifying characteristics. You can nurture these contacts through the Mautic marketing automation platform.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.mautic.org/docs/en/contacts/managing_contacts.html" target="_blank">Manage Contacts</a> section provides more information on what you can manage with standard contacts.</p>

<p>Each contact has a detail page where you can see what Mautic knows about him/her.</p>
<h2 id="engagements-points-chart">Engagements/Points chart</h2>
<p>The Engagements line chart display how active the contact was in the past 6 months. Engagement is any action the contact made. E.g. page hit, form submission, email open and so on. The chart displays also the points which the contact received.</p>
<h2 id="avatar">Avatar</h2>
<p>Mautic will try to download the contact's avatar image based on his/her email address from the <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/" target="_blank">Gravatar</a> service. But it can be loaded also from some social networks.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The main tab displays the contact's action history sorted from the latest to the oldest. Each action will display as many details as there is about it. For example a form submission will display what values the contact submitted, the email send action will inform you whether the email was opened and when and so on. You can filter what actions you want to include or exclude from the timeline if you are searching for a specific one.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Mautic can be used as a basic CRM. You or your teammates can write notes for a specific contact. A note can be marked with a specific purpose: General, Email, Call, Meeting. It's also possible to define a date of a meeting or a call. If you do so, the note will also appear in the Mautic calendar.</p>
<h2 id="social">Social</h2>
<p>If the social plugins like Facebook or Twitter are enabled and authorized and the contact provided you a username for a social network, Mautic can display his/her feed for the social network in the Social tab. Most of the social networks limited their API since the feature was developed so search by email is not working.</p>
<h2 id="map">Map</h2>
<p>If Mautic knows the coordinates of the contact from a geolocation IP lookup service, it will display a fourth tab with a map so you can easily see where in the world the contact is located. If Mautic knows more locations for this contact as he/she travels, you'll see all the locations there. If Mautic doesn't know any location, the tab won't show up.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mautic.org/docs/en/contacts/media/change-segments.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail. Select <em>Segments</em>. A modal box will show up where you'll see all the segments. The green switch means that the contact belongs to the segment, the orange switch means the opposite. Click the switch to add/remove the contact to/from the segment.</p>

<p>Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail. Select <em>Campaigns</em>. A modal box will show up where you'll see all the campaigns. The green switch means that the contact belongs to the campaign, the orange switch means the opposite. Click the switch to add/remove the contact to/from the campaign.</p>

<p>If you have 2 contacts in the Mautic database who are physically one person, you can merge them with the Merge feature. Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail, select the <em>Merge</em> item, a modal box will show up. Search for the contact you want to merge into the current contact. The select box will update as you search. Select the right contact and hit the <em>Merge</em> button.</p>

<p>The drop down menu in the top right corner of the contact detail page also lets you send an email directly to the contact. You can fill in <em>From Name</em>, <em>From</em> (email address), <em>Subject</em> and the <em>Body</em> message. You can also <em>Import from an existing template</em>. If you select some email from this select box, the Subject and the Body textarea will be prefilled from that pre-defined email template. Emails sent by this method are not tracked by Mautic.</p>

<p>The Engagements line chart display how active the contact was in the past 6 months. Engagement is any action the contact made. E.g. page hit, form submission, email open and so on. The chart displays also the points which the contact received.</p>
<h2 id="avatar">Avatar</h2>
<p>Mautic will try to download the contact's avatar image based on his/her email address from the <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/" target="_blank">Gravatar</a> service. But it can be loaded also from some social networks.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The main tab displays the contact's action history sorted from the latest to the oldest. Each action will display as many details as there is about it. For example a form submission will display what values the contact submitted, the email send action will inform you whether the email was opened and when and so on. You can filter what actions you want to include or exclude from the timeline if you are searching for a specific one.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Mautic can be used as a basic CRM. You or your teammates can write notes for a specific contact. A note can be marked with a specific purpose: General, Email, Call, Meeting. It's also possible to define a date of a meeting or a call. If you do so, the note will also appear in the Mautic calendar.</p>
<h2 id="social">Social</h2>
<p>If the social plugins like Facebook or Twitter are enabled and authorized and the contact provided you a username for a social network, Mautic can display his/her feed for the social network in the Social tab. Most of the social networks limited their API since the feature was developed so search by email is not working.</p>
<h2 id="map">Map</h2>
<p>If Mautic knows the coordinates of the contact from a geolocation IP lookup service, it will display a fourth tab with a map so you can easily see where in the world the contact is located. If Mautic knows more locations for this contact as he/she travels, you'll see all the locations there. If Mautic doesn't know any location, the tab won't show up.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mautic.org/docs/en/contacts/media/change-segments.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail. Select <em>Segments</em>. A modal box will show up where you'll see all the segments. The green switch means that the contact belongs to the segment, the orange switch means the opposite. Click the switch to add/remove the contact to/from the segment.</p>

<p>Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail. Select <em>Campaigns</em>. A modal box will show up where you'll see all the campaigns. The green switch means that the contact belongs to the campaign, the orange switch means the opposite. Click the switch to add/remove the contact to/from the campaign.</p>

<p>If you have 2 contacts in the Mautic database who are physically one person, you can merge them with the Merge feature. Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail, select the <em>Merge</em> item, a modal box will show up. Search for the contact you want to merge into the current contact. The select box will update as you search. Select the right contact and hit the <em>Merge</em> button.</p>

<p>The drop down menu in the top right corner of the contact detail page also lets you send an email directly to the contact. You can fill in <em>From Name</em>, <em>From</em> (email address), <em>Subject</em> and the <em>Body</em> message. You can also <em>Import from an existing template</em>. If you select some email from this select box, the Subject and the Body textarea will be prefilled from that pre-defined email template. Emails sent by this method are not tracked by Mautic.</p>

<p>Each contact has a detail page where you can see what Mautic knows about him/her.</p>
<h2 id="engagements-points-chart">Engagements/Points chart</h2>
<p>The Engagements line chart display how active the contact was in the past 6 months. Engagement is any action the contact made. E.g. page hit, form submission, email open and so on. The chart displays also the points which the contact received.</p>
<h2 id="avatar">Avatar</h2>
<p>Mautic will try to download the contact's avatar image based on his/her email address from the <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/" target="_blank">Gravatar</a> service. But it can be loaded also from some social networks.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The main tab displays the contact's action history sorted from the latest to the oldest. Each action will display as many details as there is about it. For example a form submission will display what values the contact submitted, the email send action will inform you whether the email was opened and when and so on. You can filter what actions you want to include or exclude from the timeline if you are searching for a specific one.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Mautic can be used as a basic CRM. You or your teammates can write notes for a specific contact. A note can be marked with a specific purpose: General, Email, Call, Meeting. It's also possible to define a date of a meeting or a call. If you do so, the note will also appear in the Mautic calendar.</p>
<h2 id="social">Social</h2>
<p>If the social plugins like Facebook or Twitter are enabled and authorized and the contact provided you a username for a social network, Mautic can display his/her feed for the social network in the Social tab. Most of the social networks limited their API since the feature was developed so search by email is not working.</p>
<h2 id="map">Map</h2>
<p>If Mautic knows the coordinates of the contact from a geolocation IP lookup service, it will display a fourth tab with a map so you can easily see where in the world the contact is located. If Mautic knows more locations for this contact as he/she travels, you'll see all the locations there. If Mautic doesn't know any location, the tab won't show up.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mautic.org/docs/en/contacts/media/change-segments.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail. Select <em>Segments</em>. A modal box will show up where you'll see all the segments. The green switch means that the contact belongs to the segment, the orange switch means the opposite. Click the switch to add/remove the contact to/from the segment.</p>

<p>Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail. Select <em>Campaigns</em>. A modal box will show up where you'll see all the campaigns. The green switch means that the contact belongs to the campaign, the orange switch means the opposite. Click the switch to add/remove the contact to/from the campaign.</p>

<p>If you have 2 contacts in the Mautic database who are physically one person, you can merge them with the Merge feature. Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail, select the <em>Merge</em> item, a modal box will show up. Search for the contact you want to merge into the current contact. The select box will update as you search. Select the right contact and hit the <em>Merge</em> button.</p>

<p>The drop down menu in the top right corner of the contact detail page also lets you send an email directly to the contact. You can fill in <em>From Name</em>, <em>From</em> (email address), <em>Subject</em> and the <em>Body</em> message. You can also <em>Import from an existing template</em>. If you select some email from this select box, the Subject and the Body textarea will be prefilled from that pre-defined email template. Emails sent by this method are not tracked by Mautic.</p>

<p>Each contact has a detail page where you can see what Mautic knows about him/her.</p>
<h2 id="engagements-points-chart">Engagements/Points chart</h2>
<p>The Engagements line chart display how active the contact was in the past 6 months. Engagement is any action the contact made. E.g. page hit, form submission, email open and so on. The chart displays also the points which the contact received.</p>
<h2 id="avatar">Avatar</h2>
<p>Mautic will try to download the contact's avatar image based on his/her email address from the <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/" target="_blank">Gravatar</a> service. But it can be loaded also from some social networks.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The main tab displays the contact's action history sorted from the latest to the oldest. Each action will display as many details as there is about it. For example a form submission will display what values the contact submitted, the email send action will inform you whether the email was opened and when and so on. You can filter what actions you want to include or exclude from the timeline if you are searching for a specific one.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Mautic can be used as a basic CRM. You or your teammates can write notes for a specific contact. A note can be marked with a specific purpose: General, Email, Call, Meeting. It's also possible to define a date of a meeting or a call. If you do so, the note will also appear in the Mautic calendar.</p>
<h2 id="social">Social</h2>
<p>If the social plugins like Facebook or Twitter are enabled and authorized and the contact provided you a username for a social network, Mautic can display his/her feed for the social network in the Social tab. Most of the social networks limited their API since the feature was developed so search by email is not working.</p>
<h2 id="map">Map</h2>
<p>If Mautic knows the coordinates of the contact from a geolocation IP lookup service, it will display a fourth tab with a map so you can easily see where in the world the contact is located. If Mautic knows more locations for this contact as he/she travels, you'll see all the locations there. If Mautic doesn't know any location, the tab won't show up.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mautic.org/docs/en/contacts/media/change-segments.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail. Select <em>Segments</em>. A modal box will show up where you'll see all the segments. The green switch means that the contact belongs to the segment, the orange switch means the opposite. Click the switch to add/remove the contact to/from the segment.</p>

<p>Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail. Select <em>Campaigns</em>. A modal box will show up where you'll see all the campaigns. The green switch means that the contact belongs to the campaign, the orange switch means the opposite. Click the switch to add/remove the contact to/from the campaign.</p>

<p>If you have 2 contacts in the Mautic database who are physically one person, you can merge them with the Merge feature. Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail, select the <em>Merge</em> item, a modal box will show up. Search for the contact you want to merge into the current contact. The select box will update as you search. Select the right contact and hit the <em>Merge</em> button.</p>

<p>The drop down menu in the top right corner of the contact detail page also lets you send an email directly to the contact. You can fill in <em>From Name</em>, <em>From</em> (email address), <em>Subject</em> and the <em>Body</em> message. You can also <em>Import from an existing template</em>. If you select some email from this select box, the Subject and the Body textarea will be prefilled from that pre-defined email template. Emails sent by this method are not tracked by Mautic.</p>

<p>Each contact has a detail page where you can see what Mautic knows about him/her.</p>
<h2 id="engagements-points-chart">Engagements/Points chart</h2>
<p>The Engagements line chart display how active the contact was in the past 6 months. Engagement is any action the contact made. E.g. page hit, form submission, email open and so on. The chart displays also the points which the contact received.</p>
<h2 id="avatar">Avatar</h2>
<p>Mautic will try to download the contact's avatar image based on his/her email address from the <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/" target="_blank">Gravatar</a> service. But it can be loaded also from some social networks.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The main tab displays the contact's action history sorted from the latest to the oldest. Each action will display as many details as there is about it. For example a form submission will display what values the contact submitted, the email send action will inform you whether the email was opened and when and so on. You can filter what actions you want to include or exclude from the timeline if you are searching for a specific one.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Mautic can be used as a basic CRM. You or your teammates can write notes for a specific contact. A note can be marked with a specific purpose: General, Email, Call, Meeting. It's also possible to define a date of a meeting or a call. If you do so, the note will also appear in the Mautic calendar.</p>
<h2 id="social">Social</h2>
<p>If the social plugins like Facebook or Twitter are enabled and authorized and the contact provided you a username for a social network, Mautic can display his/her feed for the social network in the Social tab. Most of the social networks limited their API since the feature was developed so search by email is not working.</p>
<h2 id="map">Map</h2>
<p>If Mautic knows the coordinates of the contact from a geolocation IP lookup service, it will display a fourth tab with a map so you can easily see where in the world the contact is located. If Mautic knows more locations for this contact as he/she travels, you'll see all the locations there. If Mautic doesn't know any location, the tab won't show up.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.mautic.org/docs/en/contacts/media/change-segments.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail. Select <em>Segments</em>. A modal box will show up where you'll see all the segments. The green switch means that the contact belongs to the segment, the orange switch means the opposite. Click the switch to add/remove the contact to/from the segment.</p>

<p>Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail. Select <em>Campaigns</em>. A modal box will show up where you'll see all the campaigns. The green switch means that the contact belongs to the campaign, the orange switch means the opposite. Click the switch to add/remove the contact to/from the campaign.</p>

<p>If you have 2 contacts in the Mautic database who are physically one person, you can merge them with the Merge feature. Click the drop down box arrow in the top right hand corner of the contact detail, select the <em>Merge</em> item, a modal box will show up. Search for the contact you want to merge into the current contact. The select box will update as you search. Select the right contact and hit the <em>Merge</em> button.</p>

<p>The drop down menu in the top right corner of the contact detail page also lets you send an email directly to the contact. You can fill in <em>From Name</em>, <em>From</em> (email address), <em>Subject</em> and the <em>Body</em> message. You can also <em>Import from an existing template</em>. If you select some email from this select box, the Subject and the Body textarea will be prefilled from that pre-defined email template. Emails sent by this method are not tracked by Mautic.</p>
