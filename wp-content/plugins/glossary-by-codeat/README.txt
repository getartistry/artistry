Improve your UX & SEO with Codeat's Glossary: a powerful auto-link engine; customizable styled tooltips, mobile settings, and much more!

== Description ==

Glossaries are a valuable option for most websites: they provide a brighter and more profitable reading experience to the user and can significantly improve your website’s SEO and ranking.

And if you are looking for the ultimate glossary plugin for your WordPress website look no further: you’ve found it!

Codeat's Glossary for WordPress is a valuable plugin that automatically creates wordlists from your content and creates styled tooltips.

Glossary allows you to create a glossary or dictionary section that groups valuable definitions and automatically links them to their relative terms inside your posts and pages.

On hover, highlighted terms in your post/page will show a tooltip with a description and a link to a dedicated post for that description.

So let’s say you write about cooking: how awesome it would be to show your readers a tooltip (and a direct link) to an ingredient’s description (or technique, or tool) right within your website?

Or let’s say you run an online store offering fishing gear. Imagine providing detailed descriptions and related products to all your merchandise without your client’s leaving your website.

Are you an affiliate marketing specialist? You can use Glossary for WordPress to include some affiliations URLs and descriptions to some of your key terms, and turn the tooltip area of the pop up into a conversion machine! Cool, uh?

And what’s even cooler is that you can use Codeat's Glossary for WordPress for free! Yup, you read right. The basic version of Glossary is – and will remain – free.
